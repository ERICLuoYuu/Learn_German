# German Articles with Country Names

In German, the use of articles with country names follows these general rules:

1. Most country names are neuter (das) and do not use an article in the nominative case.
2. Some countries always use an article (usually feminine or masculine).
3. Plural country names always use the definite article "die".

## Countries without Articles

Most countries don't use an article in the nominative case. For example:

- Deutschland (Germany)
- Frankreich (France)
- Spanien (Spain)
- Mexiko (Mexico)
- Österreich (Austria)

Example: "Ich komme aus Deutschland." (I come from Germany.)

## Countries with Articles

Some countries always use an article:

### Masculine (der):

- der Iran
- der Irak
- der Sudan
- der Kongo
- der Jemen

### Feminine (die):

- die Schweiz (Switzerland)
- die Türkei (Turkey)
- die Ukraine
- die Mongolei

### Neuter (das):

- das Vereinigte Königreich (the United Kingdom)

### Plural (die):

- die Niederlande (the Netherlands)
- die USA (the United States)
- die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate (the United Arab Emirates)

Example: "Ich komme aus der Schweiz." (I come from Switzerland.)

## Case Changes

When using prepositions, the article (if present) changes according to the case:

- Nominative: die Schweiz
- Accusative: in die Schweiz (to Switzerland)
- Dative: in der Schweiz (in Switzerland)
- Genitive: der Schweiz (of Switzerland)

For countries without articles, only the preposition changes:

- nach Deutschland (to Germany)
- in Deutschland (in Germany)
- aus Deutschland (from Germany)

even countries that don't use articles in the nominative case may require one in other cases or with certain prepositions.
